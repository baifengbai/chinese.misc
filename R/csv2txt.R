#' Write Texts in CSV into Many TXT/RTF Files
#'
#' The function writes texts in a given .csv file into seperated .txt/.rtf files with file names added.
#'
#' Arguments \code{which} and \code{name_col} should be set in accordance 
#' with \code{row.names}. Suppose your .csv file has 3 columns, the 1st column is for row names, 
#' the 2nd for filenames, the 3rd for fulltexts. In so far as the 1st column is for row names 
#' and \code{row.names} should be 1, your data frame only has two columns, and the 
#' fulltexts are in the 2nd column, so set \code{which} to 2 (not 3), and \code{name_col}
#' should be 1. If the .csv file do not have row names and its 1st column is for filenames, 2nd 
#' column for fulltexts, then \code{which} should be 2, and \code{name_col} is 1.
#' 
#' In writing .txt/.rtf files, the function gives each file a unique number as part of its filename. The 
#' mechanism is as follows: suppose you have 1234 files, as this number has four digits, a 
#' series of numbers 0001, 0002,...0012,...0300,...1234 are assigned rather 
#' than 1, 2,...12,...300,...1234. There are several reasons to do this: first, if \code{name_col} 
#' is \code{NULL}, this procedure automatically assigns names. Second, the column you 
#' specify may have duplicate names. Third, even the column does not have duplicate names, 
#' the process the function modifies the names to make them valid may 
#' also produce duplicate names. Fourth, numbers with full digits make it easy to sort them 
#' in any software.
#'
#' @param csv a .csv file. One of its columns contains texts to be written.
#' @param folder a name of a folder that stores the .txt/.rtf files 
#' created by the function. The folder may 
#' already exist. If it does not exist, the function will try to create it recursively. If it cannot 
#' be created, an error will be raised. See \code{\link{dir.create}}. Note: a name that contains 
#' no punctuation is prefered.
#' @param which a number: which column contains texts. See Details
#' @param header should the .csv file be read with its first row as header? This argument is 
#' passed to \code{\link{read.csv}}. Default is \code{TRUE}. 
#' @param row.names should only be \code{NULL} or 1. This means whether your .csv file 
#' has no column for row names, or row names are in the 1st column.
#' it will be passed to \code{\link{read.csv}}. See Details.
#' @param na_in_csv character vector indicating what content in the .csv file's cells should be 
#' taken as \code{NA}. The default values are "", " ", "?", "NA", "999"; and you can 
#' specify other values. But whatever you specify, the default values will always be taken 
#' as \code{NA}. If you do not provide a character vector, the default values are used.
#' @param na_in_txt a length 1 character specifying what to write into a .txt file if 
#' a csv cell is \code{NA}. The default is " " (a space).
#' @param name_col a length 1 number to indicate which column of your data should be taken 
#' as filenames. If it is \code{NULL} (default), a unique number will be given to each file, 
#' See Detail. If a cell is taken to be \code{NA}, it will be converted to ""; if it is too long, 
#' only the first 90 characters are used; one or more blanks and punctuations 
#' will be replaced by " " (a space).
#' @param ext the extension of files to be written. Should be "txt", "rtf" or "". 
#' If it is not one of the three, it is set to "".
#'
#' @return nothing is returned and .txt/rtf files are written into the folder.
