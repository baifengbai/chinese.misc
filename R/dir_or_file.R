#' Collect Full Filenames from a Mix of Directories and Files
#'
#' The input can be one or more directories, one or more files, or the mixture of the two. 
#' It will return the full paths of all files in a recursive way, 
#' and sort them in increasing order. When files are put in 
#' different areas of your disk, you may need this function to collect them. 
#' It is essentially a wrapper of \code{\link{list.files}}.
#'
#' Failure may occur when obtaining absolute paths, please see \code{\link{normalizePath}} 
#' for possible reasons.
#'
#' @param ... names of directories and files; if the input is not vector, the function will try to 
#' coerce it. Relative paths and paths starting with "~/" are also accepted. 
#' In Windows, both "/"  and double inversed slashes inside filenames are accepted.
#' @param special a length 1 character or regular expression. Only filenames that have this pattern
#' will be collected. Default value is "" (character with size 0), and is to collect everything. 
#'
#' @return a character vector of full filenames with increasing order, and every name is 
#' unique. If no filename is collected, an error will be raised.
