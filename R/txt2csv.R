#' Write Many Separated Files into a CSV
#'
#' Given filenames, folder names, or the mixture of the two, the function will read texts 
#' in .txt or other separated files, and then write 
#' them into one .csv file. It helps those who prefer texts in a table format.
#' 
#' Whether a file is taken as \code{NA} is judged by \code{\link{scancn}}. " " (a space) 
#' is also taken as \code{NA}. However, you 
#' can further decide what else is deemed as \code{NA}, e. g., "404 ERROR", if your texts are from 
#' websites. If a file cannot be accessed, the result to be 
#' written in the corresponding cell of csv file will become \code{NA}, and there will be a 
#' message, but no error is raised.
#' In the .csv file, full filenames of txt occupy a column and fulltexts occupy another.
#'
#' @param ... names of folders and files, obtained files may end with ".txt" or not , see below.
#' Encoding for each file is auto-detected.
#' @param csv a .csv file that will contain texts. It must end with ".csv".
#' @param must_txt should be \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. Should all qualified texts 
#' end with ".txt"? If you want to read other types of file, such as .rtf, set 
#' it to \code{FALSE}. Default is \code{TRUE}.
#' @param na_in_txt character vector that specifies what content, when it occupies a single line, 
#' should be treated as \code{NA}. See Details. Length of it can be larger than 1.
