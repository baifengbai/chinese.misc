\title{Simple Rise or Fall Trend of Several Years}
\usage{
topic_trend(year, topic, relative = FALSE, zero = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{a numeric vector of years for corresponding topics, 
if it is not numeric, the function will try to 
coerce. The years should be written in full-digit, that is, if they are 1998 and 2013, 
do not simply write 98 and 13. No \code{NA} is allowed. And, the number of 
unique years is at least 3, otherwise an error will be raised.}

\item{topic}{a character vector of topics. If it is not character, the function will
try to coerce. The length of topic and year should be the same. No \code{NA}
is allowed.}

\item{relative}{if \code{FALSE} (default), the numbers of topics is used. If 
\code{TRUE}, the pecentage of a topic in a year against the total number
of that year is used. Suppose this year we have 200 texts on art, and the total
number of texts in this year is 1000, then the relative value 
is 200/1000 = 0.2 rather than the absolute number 200. Note: if to use
relative value, \code{NA} of the amount of a topic will be 
automatically set to 0.}

\item{zero}{this can only be 0 (default) or \code{NA}. Suppose we have
0 text on a certain topic, then you will make sure whether the amount 
is really 0, or the data of this topic in that year is missing. Set this
argument to \code{NA} to make all 0 into \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
a list. The 1st element is trend info. The 2nd is a summary of amount
of each topic in each year. If argument relative is \code{TRUE}, a 3rd
element is returned, which is the relative value (percentage) of each
topic in each year.
}
\description{
When topic names and corresponding years are given, this function computes 
the rise and fall trend during the period by \code{\link[stats]{lm}}.
}
\details{
The detail of trend info in the result is as follows:

\itemize{
  \item (1) trendIndex: a regression with function \code{lm} is done for every
topic with year as x and amount of topics as y. The value of trendIndex
is the slope k in y = kx+b. 
  \item (2) trendLevel: the p value of k.
  \item (3) totalTrend: if trendIndex is larger than 0, then "rise", otherwise "fall".
If trendLevel is smaller than 0.05, than "significant rise" or "significant fall". 
  \item (4) maxminYear: if totalTrend is "rise" or "significant rise", then this value
points out which year has the largest amount. If several years have the largest 
value, the most recent year is retured. If totalTrend is "fall" or "significant fall", 
the year has the smallest amount is returned.
  \item (5) detailTrend: if totalTrend is "rise" or "significant rise", then the function
will see whether the year has the largest amount is the last year, if it is, then 
"rise along", otherwise "rise and fall". If totalTrend is "fall" or "significant fall", 
the function will see whether the year has the smallest amount is the
last year, if it is, then "fall along", otherwise "fall and rise".
  \item (6) simpleTrend: it is simply whether the amount of the last year 
is larger than that of the first year. If yes, then "rise", if smaller, then "fall", if 
the same, then "equal". 
}

When computing trend for a topic, if less than 3 years has valid value and value
in other years are all \code{NA}, then trendIndex, trendLevel and 
maxminYear will be -999, and other cells are "less than 3y". If the numbers of a topic do not
change through years, then trendIndex will be 0, trendLevel and maxminYear will be -999, totalTrend 
and detailTrend will be "almost same".
